<h2> Module 1 Challenge </h2>
Module 1's challenge was all about making the website given to us accessible. I did this by first condensing 
a few repeat CSS selectors into one selector, pictured below. This made the CSS file much more streamlined
and readable. 

<img src="assets\images\streamline.png" height="350px">

<br>

Next, I went into the HTML and added alt texts to each image, making the site more accessible to those who
require screen readers.

<br>

I also did a few touch-ups here and there, like adding a title to the website, as well as making sure all
links redirected to where they needed to go. Lastly, I adjusted the order of selectors in the CSS file just
a smidge, to put similar selectors next to one another.
